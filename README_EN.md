# Display Qien

A Fabric mod for Minecraft servers that recreates the functionality of LMBishop's [DisplayItem](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/displayitem-abandoned.28931/) plugin as much as possible through a mod to compensate for the inability of Fabric servers to use plugins and to support higher versions.

Features

Use the command `/displayitem` to share information about the item you are holding, including but not limited to its name and status.
